For bootstrap_value
-------------------

* ~~Run a single bootstrap for calculating mean and confidence intervals. Store this. This will probably be a list with the bootstraps for every row value in its on vector.~~

* ~~Make a class for result object with print function only showing the summary output~~
* ~~Make a subtract function that can subtract the bootstrap values from a value (e.g. reference value). This creates another object of the same class (with updated summary printout)~~

* Make a difference method where you can specify a row in bootstrap output to calculate differences from. Could use the general subtraction method.

This would give you the option to get do comparisons with a separate reference point or an arbitraty reference level in the data, with accurate bootstrap confidence values.
